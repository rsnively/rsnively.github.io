<title>Project Euler Problem 1</title>
    <h1>Problem 1</h1>
        <h2>The Problem:</h2>
            <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.<br><br>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<p>
        <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <p>This problem is more of an exercise using the website than in actual coding... It brings to mind<a href='http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/'> this article</a> about programming interviews (as well as the interview I had for my student developer job which employed just this question). But there are some cool tidbits of optimization here.</p>
            <p>This is the naivest approach I can think of:
                <pre><code>
&#35;include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
                           
int main()
{
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0)
        {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    cout << sum << endl;
}
                </code></pre></p>
                
            <p>Since this problem is so simple, it can actually be done by hand with a four-step arithmetic approach:<br>
                1. The greatest common multiple of 3 and 5 below 1000 is 990. The rest of our calculations will concern only numbers up to this point. So we account for the remaining numbers (993, 995, 996, 999) by adding them: 993 + 995 + 996 + 999 = 3983 = N1.<br>
                2. Next we worry about all the multiples of 3 up to 990. This can be done using the non iterative approach of finding the sum of numbers 1 to n: S = n(n+1)/2<br>
                   For multiples of 3 up to 990 we use the formula N2 = 330(990 + 3)/2 = 163845<br>
                3. Similarly for multiples of 5, we use N3 = 198(990 + 5)/2 = 98505<br>
                4. Now we need to subtract the multiples of 15. Since there are 66 terms which are multiples of 15 from 1 to 990 we use N4 = 66(990 + 15)/2 = 33165<br>
                
            Now that we have all of the numbers we need, we can calculate our answer through the operation N1 + N2 + N3 - N4
